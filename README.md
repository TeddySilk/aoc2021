# Advent of Code 2021
This repository contains my python3 solutions to the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) problems. The amount of documentation is directly correlated with the perceived complexity of the particular problem.

# Select and run
Run selector.py and input the days and parts of interest. It supports a list of days and list of parts, using comma as a separator:

``` shell
python3 selector.py days parts
```

For example, running both parts for days 1 through 3 would simply require typing in:

``` shell
python3 selector.py 1,2,3 1,2
```
